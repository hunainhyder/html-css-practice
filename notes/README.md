# CSS Properties and values

> We use CSS properties to tell CSS what styling to apply on an HTML element

The syntax is:

```
property: value;
```

The value specifies more accurately the style. For example:

```
text-align: center;
color: blue;
```

Here **text-align** is a property that tells the browser to do something with the alignment of the text on screen but what exactly it has to do it with. The "**center**" word which is the value tells more specifically the browser to center it. So now using a pair of both the **property** and **value**, the browser knows exactly what to do with the text on the screen

In the same way on the second line **color** tells the browser to change the color of the text but to what color. Now here **blue** tells the browser to change it to blue.
