# CSS Properties and values

> We use CSS properties to tell CSS what styling to apply on an HTML element

The syntax is:

```
property: value;
```

The value specifies more accurately the style. For example:

```
text-align: center;
color: blue;
```

Here **text-align** is a property that tells the browser to do something with the alignment of the text on screen but not exactly what to do. It just tells change the alignment but does not where to. The "**center**" word which is the value tells more specifically the browser to center it. So now using a pair of both the **property** and **value**, the browser knows exactly what to do with the text on the screen.

In the same way on the second line **color** tells the browser to change the color of the text but to what color. Now here **blue** tells the browser to change it to blue.

This is how properties and value are written in CSS.
